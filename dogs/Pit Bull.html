          <p>pit bull, also called American Pit Bull Terrier or Pit Bull Terrier, fighting dog developed in 19th-century England, Scotland, and Ireland from bulldog and terrier ancestry for hunting, specifically capturing and restraining semi-feral livestock. The name has been applied historically to several breeds of dogs—including the bull terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, and Staffordshire Bull Terrier—but it is not recognized as a distinct breed by the American Kennel Club.</p>
