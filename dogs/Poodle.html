          <p>A typical Poodle is bright, energetic, and friendly. Although they can be standoffish with strangers at first, they’re quick to warm. Because they’re not particularly territorial, they make bad watchdogs and questionable guard dogs. However, when there’s a clear danger, they’ll protect their owners and families. For the most part, though, they’re quiet, calm, and alert, and act as a playful and perceptive companion to their owners and families.</p>
